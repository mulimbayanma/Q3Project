 <td>Never Leave Your Kitchen Unattended Whilst Cooking</td>
<td>The most common cause of fires is people leaving their kitchen unattended while they are cooking. You should never leave your kitchen because you might forget that you are cooking and it will definitely cause a fire. Stay in the kitchen as much as possible, if you need a break, turn off the heat because you do not want to risk it.</td>

 <td>Unplug Appliances When Not In Use</td>
<td>Plugging appliances even when you are not using them are one of the main causes of fires. Always make sure to unplug items from outlets when you are done using them. It could cause an explosion. Especially at night, never charge your phone. It can make your phone overheat and the outlet might explode.</td>

 <td>Do Not Let Children Play With Fire</td>
<td>Never let children play with fire because they usually don't know what they are doing. Children usually play with fire in a hidden place â€“ such as a closet or in a bedroom. In these places, clothing, mattresses, and bedding can easily catch on fire. Kids who play with fire can just end up hurting others, burning themselves, or worse, burning the whole house.</td>

 <td><img src="https://jenkinsrestorations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/candle-fire.jpg" class="rounded"></td>
 <td>Be Careful Of Candles</td>
<td>Wax from candles can start fires. The candle flame's heat will cause the hot wax to melt, forming a pool of wax that could catch fire. This is the reason candles should never be left burning unattended. Wax, the material that makes up candles, burns at extremely high temperatures and is very flammable.</td>
